  Atranscript: "Welcome,\_dear tenant,\_ to a lovely night at Cecita Rental. If you
    are hearing this, we\u2018ve created an exciting experience [pause] just for
    you.\r\nDuring the night, if you wake up in an unfamiliar space, don't panic.
    This is perfectly normal. Follow the directions and calmly walk back to your
    room.\r\nIn the situation where your room is not in the same location, find the
    24-hour emergency service room available on every floor. Our beloved operators
    are here to help.\r\nFor your own safety during every special night experience,
    don't try to run. If you are lucky enough to avoid the highly possible demise,
    please pay close attention next day to the regular broadcast.\r\nRemember, the
    broadcast starts at 5 pm every afternoon.\r\n\nWe hope you have a pleasant night."
