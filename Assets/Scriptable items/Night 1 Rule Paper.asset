  - "Tonight's Rules\n\n3. Hear jazz music? It means the Lounge is open! Feel free
    to enter and take a nap.\r\r\n8. Only 1 person is allowed in the lounge! Do not
    open the door for others.\r\r\n6. Hear doors opening? Close your eyes and respect
    your neighbors\u2019 privacy.\r\r\n0. Do not interact with strangers talking
    to you. No one would be out at this time of day. Ignore them.\r\r\n9. The wind
    may blow doors open. RUN.\r\r\n7. If you violate any of the rules above, you
    will be checked out permanently.\n\n(small handwriting) good luck"
