  - '3. Hear jazz music? It means the Lounge is open to public! Feel free to enter
    inside and take a nap.

    8. Only 1 person is allowed in the lounge! Do not
    open the lounge door for others to enter if you are inside.

    6. Hear doors
    opening? Close your eyes and respect your neighbors'' privacy.

    1. Do not
    interact with strangers talking to you. No one would be out in the hallway at
    this time of day. Please ignore them.

    5. The wind may blow doors open. RUN.
