  Atranscript: "1. When you hear jazz, it means that the Lounge is open to the public!
    You are welcome to enter. It provides a safe space for you to relax and have
    a cup of coffee.\r\n2. Only ONE person is allowed in the Lounge and other tenants
    know that too. Make sure you hear and only hear silence before opening the door.
    \r\n3. No one would be out in the hallway at this time of day. If you hear them,
    ignore all whispers and keep walking. Eventually, your hallucination will fade
    away.\n4. The sound of doors opening and closing in the hallway is your neighbors
    having a nightmare. Please respect their privacy and keep your eyes closed.\r\n5.
    The wind may sometimes blow doors open, it\u2019s just the wind, nothing is behind
    you. If you don\u2019t want to catch a cold. Run.\r\n6. If you violate any of
    the rules above, we\u2019ll have to kindly check you out of this apartment permanently."
